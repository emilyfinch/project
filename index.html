I really like painting and collectible figures, so those make up the majority of the decoration in my room. I also enjoy collecting various art prints from artists and tv shows that I like that I collage onto my wall.
<p>
The collage on my wall includes
</p>
<ul>Rick And Morty Poster</ul>
<ul>Keith Haring postcard</ul>
<ul>Basquiat postcard</ul>
<ul>Fan art I made of Zenitsu from Demon Slayer</ul>
